We're told that on his body was found a diary. On the flyleaf under the heading, "My Pledge", he had written these words: "America must win this war. Therefore I will work, I will save, I will sacrifice, I will endure, I will fight cheerfully and do my utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle depended on me alone."
